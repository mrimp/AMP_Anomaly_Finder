# Docs scaffold

This folder is intentionally **not required** for the application to run.

Use it to store release assets for GitHub (screenshots, diagrams, etc.).

## Suggested structure

- `docs/screenshots/` — UI screenshots for README / Releases
- `docs/assets/` — any other repo-only assets (logos, diagrams)

## Screenshot naming

Suggested names (update README links if you prefer different names):

- `docs/screenshots/screenshot-01.png` — main view
- `docs/screenshots/screenshot-02.png` — anomalies view
- `docs/screenshots/screenshot-03.png` — System Tools panel
